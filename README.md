## Description

README.md files for projects in a more organized manner.

## Installation and Usage

Downloading the repo will download all dependincies and code to make the node.js application work.
After downloading and navigating the repo, users can input "node index.js" into the terminal to start
the application where users will then answer a series of questions that they are prompted with. After
going through all the questions users will then be able to navigate to the README folder to find the 
created README.md file for use.
